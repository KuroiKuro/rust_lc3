# Rust LC3 VM
A VM written in Rust that emulates the LC3 ISA architecture. Inspired by the [tutorial](https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/) written by Justin Meiners and Ryan Pendleton.

Still a work in progress!

# Getting Started
To get started, you may use `cargo` to compile and run the executable. The path to an LC3 program should be given as the first positional argument
```bash
cargo run /path/to/program
```
